"""Patient-aware train/val/test splitting.

The cardinal rule: every trace from one ``simulation_id`` (the patient
analog — one simulator substrate realization, or one IAFDB recording for
the real-data bank) lands entirely in one split. Random per-trace
splitting lets the model see the same fibrosis-pattern realization in
train and val, which inflates val metrics — a failure mode that has
burned multiple cardiology-ML papers. Splitting by patient closes that
leak.

We additionally *stratify* by a per-patient key chosen by a
:class:`PatientStratificationStrategy` so the (typically imbalanced)
class ratio is preserved across the three splits. Without
stratification, a small dataset can land all healthy patients in one
split by chance.

The strategy is pluggable: callers pick whichever stratification key
makes sense for their bank's labeling scheme. See
:mod:`myocard_egm_data.splits.strategies` for the shipped strategies
and instructions on adding new ones.

    ----------
    simulation_id
        ``[N]`` patient id per trace (integer-factorized upstream).

        ``[N]`` integer label per trace. The strategy decides how to
