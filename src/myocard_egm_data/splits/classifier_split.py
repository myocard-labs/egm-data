"""Run :func:`patient_aware_split` against a ClassifierBank and (optionally)
write the assigned split name back onto each :class:`ClassifierTrace`.

Two ways to use this:

- :func:`split_classifier_bank` is the high-level helper: pulls
  patient_id + label_truth out of the ClassifierBank, runs the split,
  and writes ``"train"`` / ``"val"`` / ``"test"`` (or whatever names
  you choose) back to every trace's ``split`` field. Returns the
  :class:`SplitIndices` if you want them.
- :func:`apply_split_indices` just writes a pre-computed
  :class:`SplitIndices` back onto the bank — useful if you've called
  the lower-level splitter yourself.

The convention: every trace ends up with ``split`` set to a string
chosen by the caller (or one of the defaults), so a downstream
consumer can serialize the ClassifierBank and the split decision is
captured on disk alongside the data.
