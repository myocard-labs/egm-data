"""``any_positive`` stratification — one bit per patient.

For each patient, the stratum is ``1`` if any trace has a positive
label, else ``0``. Two equivalence classes total: "patient contains
some fibrotic substrate" vs "patient is entirely healthy".

Why this is the default:

- **Global-density labels** make every patient single-class by
  construction (the global density is either above or below threshold).
  Under this strategy, the per-patient stratum exactly recovers the
  per-patient label — the splitter behaves identically to the original
  pre-strategy implementation.
- **Local-density labels** make a patient's traces span both classes;
  the per-patient label concept no longer exists. ``any_positive``
  collapses this to "does this patient have any fibrotic neighborhood
  at all?", which is the coarsest non-trivial stratification: it
  guarantees that splits don't accidentally end up entirely free of
  fibrotic patients.

The coarseness is the trade-off: under local-density, a patient with
1% positive traces gets stratified the same way as a patient with 50%
positive traces. If your bank skews heavily one way and the resulting
val/test splits still come out class-imbalanced, switch to
:class:`~myocard_egm_data.splits.strategies.binned_density.BinnedDensityStrategy`.
