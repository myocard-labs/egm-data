"""``binned_density`` stratification — finer-grained class-rate bucketing.

For each patient, compute the per-trace positive rate ``mean(labels)``
and return the integer bin index in ``[0, n_bins - 1]``. Patients
within the same bin are considered equivalent for stratification
purposes, so the splitter distributes each bin proportionally across
train/val/test.

When this matters over
:class:`~myocard_egm_data.splits.strategies.any_positive.AnyPositiveStrategy`:

- **Local-density labels with a continuous fibrosis-density gradient.**
  Most patients have *some* fibrotic traces, so ``any_positive`` lumps
  them together regardless of how fibrotic they are. ``binned_density``
  separates lightly-fibrotic patients from heavily-fibrotic ones, so the
  val/test splits get a representative sample across the gradient.
- **When the bank is heavily skewed and ``any_positive`` still produces
  trace-class-imbalanced val/test splits.** The post-split diagnostic
  in :func:`~myocard_egm_data.datasets.build_dataloaders` warns when
  this happens; ``binned_density`` is the typical fix.

Degenerates to ``any_positive`` behavior on global-density banks:
every patient has rate 0.0 or 1.0, which always lands in the first
or last bin regardless of ``n_bins``, so any in-between bins are
empty and the stratification matches ``any_positive``.

Bin edges are uniformly spaced over ``[0, 1]``. Rate 0.0 lands in
bin 0; rate 1.0 lands in bin ``n_bins - 1`` (right edge closed).
